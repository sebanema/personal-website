            <p>My evening ritual was simple. I exercised, ate a phenomenal portion of mince and eggs, and then shamelessly slid into a sacramental YouTube session. I liked to imagine I was superior to the TikTok generation, consuming longer, &ldquo;wholesome&rdquo; content like nature documentaries, podcasts, and whatever educational video intellectually stimulated me. I sprinkled in some comedy too so I didn&rsquo;t become an absolute bore. Back then, TikTok was something only the teenagers indulged in. Now it has conquered the planet. Amidst the disruption of short-form content, YouTube obliged and created Youtube Shorts. Without downloading a single new app, I had become part of the generation I thought I was above.</p>

            <p>My monkey brain had found a new lever to pull, and Shorts had set me loose. Only now did I understand why the kids loved it so much. Gone were the days I would sit through hours of video to finally get to the &ldquo;good stuff.&rdquo; Now, I could consume the most valuable parts of content faster, learn more, and become hyperproductive. Or so I told myself. I could have a quick session while waiting in line, another while cooking, another while brushing my teeth&mdash;I could even have one while sitting on the crapper. Shorts gave me a sense of completion long-form never could. Five minutes into a long-form video, I&rsquo;d unconsciously check to see how much time was left. But after a few Shorts, I&rsquo;d be fully revved up, feeling rewarded for consuming such &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; content in such a short space of time. Or so I told myself.</p>

            <p>Just as suddenly as the Shorts had enveloped my world, my expectations&mdash;like Icarus&mdash;burnt into ashy dust. In my revved, inebriated state, I would escalate to doomscrolling Twitter (X) or hopping onto Instagram. I&rsquo;d even spend time on Melissa&rsquo;s Instagram&mdash;the friend-of-a-cousin I met at Christmas six years ago&mdash;feeling absolutely exuberant that I could watch her do yoga in Bali while I looped between office and apartment. The whole time I told myself I was unwinding, when really I was just marinating my neurons in thick, crystallised gloop. These technologies were sirens whispering dirty promises, luring me to watch one more reel. If I couldn&rsquo;t resist their pull, they&rsquo;d drag me into the depths. Or so I told myself.</p>

            <p>I began a laptop session trying to figure out how to install a Chrome adblocker. &ldquo;How to get rid of ads&rdquo; is what I typed into Google. The first thing that popped up was a sponsored result: &ldquo;Top 4 adblockers you never knew you needed.&rdquo; Intrigued, I clicked. Before I knew it, my attention was stolen by the ads on the sidebar. One showed the exact microphone I had been chatting to my girlfriend about. Strange, I thought. I clicked on it. Nope, too expensive. I searched Google for that specific microphone instead and clicked on a YouTube video for an in-depth review. Two minutes in, I got bored. I clicked out of full-screen and saw the recommendations. A rush of dopamine hit me, similar to the feeling of walking into a bakery and seeing buttery pastries displayed before my eyes. I saw a new Theo Von clip that had my name on it. I finished the 12-minute video and transitioned to a shorter one of a brass quintet serenading cows in a pasture. It made me unreasonably happy that the cows also appreciated music. The video ended, and immediately a &ldquo;watch next&rdquo; pop-up appeared. I saw a strikingly colorful thumbnail titled: &ldquo;I Ate Nothing But Raw Meat for 30 Days | Full Documentary.&rdquo; I was too deep now; I could not resist. An hour later, the documentary finally ended, and an ad popped up for Monday.com. I suddenly awoke from my reverie, realising I was supposed to be turning off the bloody ads. I felt dazed, a bit shameful. A slight headache began to form. Anxiety tingled through my body as I lifted myself from my stupor and walked outside, hoping the sunlight would forgive me for my sins.</p>

            <p>I never did learn how to turn on the adblocker.</p>

            <p>But I did write a semi-viral comment on a YouTube shorts vid. It was one of those brainrot videos showing the route you&rsquo;d walk from South Africa to the USA, country by country&mdash;through Sudan, Israel-Palestine, Syria, Russia. My contribution to the discourse was the following:</p>

            <figure class="post-image">

            </figure>

            <p>Now that I was aware the platforms had a tight grip on me, I had no other choice but to delete YouTube from my phone&mdash;a classic trick I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve used before. Just hack my way to temperance, I thought. I began using the Apple Screen Time app and BlockSite extensions for my laptop. Once again, I would become superior to the TikTok generation.</p>

            <p>Initially, it worked. But as soon as pressure mounted, or I was fragile from a late night, my mind weakened. The Great Wall between me and the platforms seemed scalable. The siren of the screen returned, soft and patient, whispering that familiar promise: &ldquo;The real world is so boring, way too demanding. Pleasure is so close&hellip; if you just click Install.&rdquo; I relented, telling myself one video surely wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. And like the hungover soul who swears they&rsquo;re never drinking again, within a week I was back in the pub. I entered a toxic relationship with my devices, deleting and redownloading the platforms the same way a couple from Geordie Shore breaks up and gets back together. Most of the time, I redownloaded because I had a totally reasonable justification: I needed YouTube for a yoga class, or Instagram to contact a new friend. All valid reasons if I was to make it in the modern world.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, I would not go all the way and delete these accounts, as I continually contemplated. That would wipe my existence away; I would lose too much. I grew up on these apps; they are the gateway to connecting with the world. After a shameful binge, I even considered removing WhatsApp&mdash;which, at its peak, accounted for over two hours of screen time a day. Surely I could find a way to moderate? Was it not my duty as a global citizen to be informed? To share every moment of my awesome life with acquaintances I hardly knew? I also justified it as the best way to have a modern education, finding sources of knowledge outside mainstream media. After all, it&rsquo;s cool to be alternative. Although I knew it had a dark side, I was committed to being better than the machine. I was sure I would find a way to keep Western consumerist agitprop from swallowing me, but the more I tried, the more it seemed futile. I would not win. I could not win. Every time I forgot how rotten I felt after a YouTube binge or an Instagram doomscroll, I&rsquo;d redownload the app and instantly relapse. I was thrust back into the echo chambers of the pleasure machine, drip-fed little hits of dopamine every time a notification pinged or someone new followed me.</p>

            <p>The game is rigged, and it wasn&rsquo;t only affecting me. It was affecting my relationships, my worldviews, and my presence in the real world. &ldquo;You are what you eat&rdquo; was grotesquely manifesting. I was a hunchback laptop slave working nine hours a day behind a screen, followed by four hours of scrolling and patrolling social media, hunting for the next fight or crisis like an overzealous mall cop starved for action. These technologies promised to connect me to the real world, but they trained me to chase an endless cycle of stimulation.</p>

            <h2>The House Always Wins</h2>

            <p>It&rsquo;s pretty much conventional wisdom now that social media platforms are harming us. My YouTube algorithm is full of people trying to go viral and make money off you&mdash;spreading the idea that Big Tech has you by the balls. I am trying to do the exact same thing here. Almost everyone has watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix, where the very people who built these platforms expose how they were designed to steal your attention. Again, this became huge on the platforms themselves&mdash;and the algorithms aren&rsquo;t even aware we are talking shit about them.</p>

            <p>But when I think about it&hellip; maybe they like it. We get supercharged on this topic, feel righteous about how broken everything is, and then spend the rest of the day consuming content about how consuming content is ruining our lives.</p>

            <p>And we love it. We are willing participants in this game. It is too easy to blame the algorithm for &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; our attention when, in reality, we are begging to use it. Our lives are full of boring daily frictions: commuting to work, silent queues at the bank, waiting for the kettle to boil. The algorithmic feed offers an escape from the mundane, and we willingly walk into the cage. You wake up after a three-hour doomscroll in a mild existential crisis, Google &ldquo;is doomscrolling bad for you,&rdquo; and click through articles and four-hour documentaries explaining that yes, this stuff is indeed frying your brain.</p>

            <p>We are actually spending more time on social media than ever before. <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-global-overview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Global social media user identities now surpass 5.24 billion, and the average adult spends approximately two hours and twenty-one minutes on social media every single day&mdash;a commitment that has increased by 56% compared to a decade ago.</a> For Gen Z, it&rsquo;s worse: <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/social-media-addiction-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">over half spend at least four hours a day, and 82% believe they&rsquo;re addicted.</a></p>

            <p>That mismatch&mdash;knowing it&rsquo;s bad and still doing it&mdash;comes down to the incentives behind the platforms. The de facto social media business model is ad-supported free content. These platforms only make money when your eyes are on the screen near ads that might nudge your next purchase. They are therefore incentivised to make you stay as long as possible. To achieve this, they hire the brightest PhDs and computer scientists to engineer features like curated algorithms and endless scrolling&mdash;mechanisms that require an insane amount of willpower to overcome. They are spending billions of dollars to do this. And now, we&rsquo;ve turbo-charged our virtual realities with the AI race, where what you see is becoming even more generated, curated, and personalised to reinforce your worldview.</p>

            <p>The reason these tactics work is that we are hardwired to chase the sugar from a rare berry bloom in spring&mdash;a survival mechanism from the days our ancestors roamed nomadically. That same drive for a &ldquo;hit&rdquo; of excitement isn&rsquo;t new; Romans packed arenas to watch gladiators fight to the death, and medieval crowds gathered for public executions. The difference is that today, we have optimised the delivery system. We are consuming hyper-normal stimuli at much faster rates, with endless feeds that create a sense of brief accomplishment. It simply steals our lives from right beneath us. If you spend just two hours a day on social media, that amounts to roughly one entire month of every year lost to a screen. Over a 60-year adult life, that is five full years spent scrolling&mdash;five years where you were neither asleep nor truly awake.</p>

            <p>Without trying to sound like a doomer, I must acknowledge that social media has brought undeniable good, specifically for creators. <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-creator-economy-could-approach-half-a-trillion-dollars-by-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Industry data suggests that while over 300 million people have entered the global creator economy, fewer than 4% earn a professional salary from it.</a> Although the vast majority earn little to nothing (myself included), the portal for &ldquo;breaking out of the matrix&rdquo; exists. Only today can you make a healthy living by sharing a weird obsession with taxidermy, funded by strangers across the globe who have an even weirder obsession with watching you do it.</p>

            <p>We have created a culture defined by niches, which has opened Pandora&rsquo;s box. Now that the box has been opened&mdash;and the marvels and the monsters are not going back inside&mdash;we have to learn how to live with what has escaped. While it has unlocked a creative freedom that never existed before, the technologies that underpin it have warped our shared information landscape. The same algorithms that find taxidermy fans also carve out endless little nooks where people can burrow deeper into their existing biases and primitive pleasures. We have never lived in an age where discerning between signal and noise is more important. And for now, Big Tech&rsquo;s platforms and their techno-oligarchs hold all the chips. They keep us at the table by dangling the chance that, if we just stay seated a little longer, we might finally hit a royal flush.</p>

            <h2>The Tower of Babel</h2>

            <p>The biblical story of the Tower of Babel offers a haunting prediction for our current moment. In the myth, humanity was united by a single language and a shared ambition: to build a tower that reached the heavens. Seeing this, God realised that &ldquo;nothing they plan to do together will be impossible for them,&rdquo; so he scattered them by confusing their language. What ensued was the tower&rsquo;s abandonment because the people could no longer understand each other. The population dispersed, and nothing like it was ever attempted again.</p>

            <p>We have just spent the last thirty years building our own tower to the heavens: the Internet. Our &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; was unity&mdash;every human mind connected, finally able to understand one another. And for a while, it worked. The world globalised, you could now call your friends from across the world, and we began to trade ideas with a freedom and speed that felt almost like magic. But now, we are scattering into polarised tribes, unable to speak the same language&mdash;unwinding the very culture the Internet first allowed us to create.</p>

            <p>It all comes back to how we share information. Through the rise of zero-cost communication, we have entered an unprecedented period where our shared story begins to fragment. Culture, at its most basic, is exactly that&mdash;a loose agreement on what words actually mean. But as that story fragments, we see the hyperinflation of language. Words that once held specific, heavy weight&mdash;like &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;Fascist&quot;&mdash;are now flung around casually to describe minor disagreements. Take the comedian Konstantin Kisin: a man who lost family in the Holocaust. He was labelled a &quot;Nazi&quot; on national radio for refusing to sign a university &quot;behavioural agreement&quot; before a comedy set. As Kisin later observed, the inevitable consequence is that if everyone is a &quot;Nazi,&quot; no one is. The word stops meaning anything. And when we no longer share a common understanding of the words we use, how are we supposed to have good-faith conversations anymore?</p>

            <p>The last time technology fractured culture at this scale was the Protestant Reformation. Before the printing press, the Catholic Church was the ultimate gatekeeper, controlling the single &quot;truth&quot; that held Europe together. But when Gutenberg lowered the cost of information, he broke the monopoly on how ideas were shared. Suddenly, revolutionaries like Martin Luther could print thousands of pamphlets, bypassing the pulpit to speak directly to the people. By putting the Bible into the hands of the common man, he shattered the Church's monopoly on truth, spawning endless splinter groups&mdash;Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists&mdash;who all read the same book but saw entirely different realities. The cost of sharing information decreased, and the cultural landscape changed with it&mdash;permanently.</p>

            <p>Over the last century, we effectively reduced the cost of communication to zero, moving from telegrams to smartphones, creating a hyper-globalised world that brought wonderful economic benefits. However, this flood of free information destabilised the old order. For decades, our &ldquo;shared story&rdquo; was curated by gatekeepers&mdash;books, newspapers, and a handful of TV networks. These outlets purported to filter out noise and deliver trusted information. But then the internet disrupted their monopoly, and the money taps stopped flowing. Legacy media had to shift their business model from print revenue to click-based engagement. Consequently, the gatekeepers began trading in sensationalism to survive.</p>

            <p>And now, we don&rsquo;t trust mainstream legacy media.</p>

            <figure class="post-image">
              <img src="/images/writing/social-media/media-trust-usa.png" alt="Chart showing declining trust in U.S. media" width="1220" height="1162" />
              <figcaption><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/695762/trust-media-new-low.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source: Trust in Media at New Low of 28% in U.S.</a></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The relentless decline in this graph represents the shattering of our common ground. For the first time in history, the number of people with &ldquo;no trust at all&rdquo; has overtaken those with trust. Lines have been crossed.</p>

            <p>We now see the audience on a great migration towards online media: the era of long-form podcasting. These platforms now effectively set the orientation of our culture, where content is chopped up, diluted into clips, and served across a plethora of social media platforms. We have traded the polished news anchors of the past for comedians &ldquo;shooting the shit&rdquo; with their friends and casually shilling Athletic Greens in the ad breaks. These podcasters replicate the feeling of sitting in a room with friends, discussing interesting ideas in an unfiltered way. The absurdity of this shift becomes clear when you look at the numbers. While a prime-time slot on a major cable network like CNN might struggle to pull 600,000 viewers, a single episode of The Joe Rogan Experience routinely draws millions. The authority has fundamentally shifted. We have stopped quoting The New York Times to instead say, &ldquo;I heard this on JRE.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>What emerges from these new media platforms is an ecosystem optimized for what is interesting rather than what is true, contextual, or impartial. This applies equally to creators like Joe Rogan and institutions like The New York Times. And although the erosion of mainstream media is obvious, alternative sources have their own faults. On The Joe Rogan Experience, this manifests as a proliferation of contrarian voices who spread non-standard, often grossly incorrect views to an audience of millions. The platforming of figures like Darryl Cooper, who has been widely criticized by historians for his views on the Holocaust, sparked outrage and illustrates the concern raised by Sam Harris:</p>

            <p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a non-standard view that can be spun at all, he wants to hear about it. And that acts like a bug light for maniacs. You can get an endless number of people with PhDs or MDs or whatever the requisite degree is who are crazy, or just terrible people. And when you have a platform like Joe has, you have a real responsibility to not just lay yourself open and your audience open to a fire hose of half-truths and lies.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Harris&rsquo;s critique holds merit, yet the situation is nuanced. I personally find JRE entertaining and valuable; it has often served as a crucial check on institutional certainty. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rogan amplified discussions about the Wuhan lab leak theory&mdash;a view that The New York Times and Facebook had previously dismissed as &ldquo;dangerous misinformation.&rdquo; That this theory was later endorsed by the FBI and became a subject of legitimate government inquiry is pivotal. When the gatekeepers lie or are confidently wrong about reality to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; us, is it any wonder we run to the comedian who asks unfiltered questions&mdash;even if he occasionally spreads half-truths himself? The audience is choosing authenticity over sanitised control.</p>

            <p>This fracture is not the fault of any individual or institution; it is a symptom of the incentives embedded in the platforms themselves. The technology has made communication free while making the consumption of information highly addictive. It is moving us away from consensus toward a fragmented landscape defined by three forces:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Algorithmic Reinforcement:</strong> Because the algorithm learns your tastes, your &ldquo;For You&rdquo; page exacerbates the personal confirmation bias of your initial opinions. It traps you in a loop of your own making, feeding you more of what you already believe until you forget other perspectives even exist.</li>
              <li><strong>Infinite Confirmation Bias:</strong> Because information is overabundant, you can find a source to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; any conspiracy theory through clever rhetoric. In the 1960s, if you believed the Earth was flat, you would be shut down by the social reality of your neighbors. Now, you and your fellow flat-earthers can group up online, stay in that Discord indefinitely, and never have to face a single piece of corrective feedback.</li>
              <li><strong>The Loss of Friction:</strong> In the offline world, there is a social cost to having &ldquo;weird&rdquo; opinions. If you tell your unfiltered Uncle Dave that you believe Bigfoot is real, he will tell you to go play a sport or meet a girl rather than spend so much time on the bloody computer. You are moderated by social embarrassment and family pushback. Online, however, that friction vanishes. You can be anonymous&mdash;a &ldquo;MrPotatoHead69&rdquo;&mdash;and find thousands of others who will cheer on your most unfiltered, hateful, or bizarre ideas in a Twitter comment section.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The result is that the new tech has splintered our reality into many different micro-realities. We are building a culture defined by words that mean different things and tribes that share radically polarising ideologies. Social media is the perpetrator; it broke the shared story that once kept us aligned and incentivised traditional institutions to lose their impartiality.</p>

            <h2>After Babel</h2>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUA2fUPQ9hY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sam Harris argues that we must rebuild the traditional institutions once held to standards of integrity.</a> I disagree&mdash;not because the old standards were wrong, but because the economic foundations that sustained them have been destroyed. When full-page newspaper ads commanded premium prices based on reputation, media institutions could afford depth and accuracy. When the internet made information free, advertising revenue collapsed and the metric shifted from building trust to generating clicks. You cannot restore integrity to institutions whose survival depends on optimising for sensationalism over truth. What we need are entirely new institutions where truth is profitable&mdash;systems where the experts we rely on are economically incentivised to have our best interests at heart.</p>

            <p>I think about Discovery Health&rsquo;s Vitality program in South Africa. People earn gym discounts, travel savings, and other perks for exercising and completing health checks. The company profits because healthier members mean fewer claims&mdash;a &ldquo;shared value&rdquo; proposition where success requires making customers genuinely healthier. <a href="https://www.svai.africa/case-studies/discovery-vitality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Studies show Vitality members live 14 years longer on average than the insured South African population.</a> This idea could extend to the information landscape: one where platforms win when the user becomes wiser and more grounded in reality&mdash;and less of an addict.</p>

            <p>It is similar to the promise of cryptocurrency. Crypto allows us to transact outside the regulated domain&mdash;to &ldquo;be our own bank.&rdquo; But then reality sets in. There&rsquo;s a massive cognitive cost to sovereignty: storing private keys, navigating exchange scams, and the anxiety of hoping you didn&rsquo;t send your coins to the wrong address. It&rsquo;s exhausting. Most people would happily trade absolute autonomy for a banker who does all the work and doesn&rsquo;t steal their money. The same applies to information. The lawyer or service worker busting their arse for 80 hours a week does not have time to fact-check every claim or read three research papers just to hold a reasonable opinion. They want a reliable system that helps them become better informed without having to become an expert themselves. Until we build systems where platforms profit from our flourishing rather than our fragmentation, we remain stuck in the wilderness, forced to be our own guides.</p>

            <p>But this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should sit back and blame the system. The same technology that shattered the old common ground also gave the average Joe the power to broadcast his ideas for almost no cost. And while this brings charlatans and grifters along for the ride, it also creates the possibility of smaller, more trustworthy networks. The individual creator earns credibility slowly, through consistency, and loses it the moment they start lying. We&rsquo;re already watching audiences migrate from legacy media to online podcasters and writers who earn their trust one episode, one essay at a time. Business models are shifting, too&mdash;from ad-driven feeds to subscription, membership, and patronage. The next phase consists of smaller towers, built with stronger foundations, and stitched together by trust instead of hype.</p>

            <p>In my own life, navigating this terrain is rarely elegant. I know I&rsquo;ll still find myself slumped after a phenomenal meal of mince and eggs, sliding into a sacramental YouTube session, watching a stranger build a &ldquo;Secret Underground Bamboo House&rdquo; alongside eighty-nine million other people. I know I&rsquo;ll end up in a comment section at 2 a.m., tired and loosened after a night out, rage-scrolling about whether Logan Paul is secretly gay. The siren will keep whispering, and I will keep pretending I&rsquo;m above it, right before I click &ldquo;watch next.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>People respond to this chaos in extreme ways. Some want to eject entirely&mdash;flee to an off-grid eco-village, take up ecstatic dance and holotropic breathwork, and microdose their way to enlightenment. Others want to become the best engineers in the world and build the platform that finally gets the incentives right. Both are understandable reactions in the civilisation we built, where we discovered we can hack our own nervous system.</p>

            <p>For the rest of us, the answer is more boring and more realistic: we choose moderation. Yes, I know. What a painfully dull word to end an essay on. But it&rsquo;s the profound lesson my grandmother taught me, and as much as I don&rsquo;t want to listen to her, I see its wisdom prevail time and time again. The best we can do is notice what we&rsquo;re paying attention to. We can build small guardrails and, when we fail ourselves, put them up again. We can choose face-to-face interactions even when a video call would have sufficed. We can go outside more. We can forgive ourselves when we relapse into a social media binge, and laugh a little at how absurd it is that we need strategies to stop ourselves from staring at LED rectangles.</p>

            <p>We can&rsquo;t pretend to have a perfect relationship with social media while the incentives are designed to capture us. But we can still put up a good fight. And I think it&rsquo;s probably our duty to do so&mdash;for our own sanity, and for the people who have to live around us.</p>
