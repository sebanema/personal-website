          <p>
            In 2022, I wrote an article detailing my experience with the CFA Level 1 exam. I had some people reach out to express their gratitude, mentioning that it inspired and assisted them in their studies. With that in mind, I thought it would be helpful to share my insights on the Level 2 exam as well.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding the "Why" in Pursuing the CFA Designation</h2>
          <p>
            The Level 2 exam is significantly tougher than Level 1, so understanding your "why" before investing time, energy, and mental well-being is crucial. For me, the CFA provided a deep understanding of finance and a strong foundation for entering any industry. Beyond that, it taught me "how to learn" more than school or university did, and instilled the confidence to tackle any problem I encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engaging in practical activities like trading and investing my own money has provided me with more specific knowledge compared to studying for the CFA exams. However, the CFA journey has significantly enhanced my ability to quickly understand and synthesize large amounts of information. Moreover, it showcases to potential employers your dedication to overcoming difficult challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember to identify your "why," write it down, and revisit it periodically during your studies, especially when losing sight of your goal during tough times.
          </p>

          <h2>Knowing your objectives</h2>
          <p>
            300 hours is an excellent resource for understanding the exam objectives. It offers numerous articles, from preparation timetables to the best study music. To gauge the competition, it is crucial to know the number of candidates you will be up against and the minimum passing score you need to achieve.
          </p>

          <h2>Historical Pass Rates</h2>
          <p>
            From 2017 to August 2021, pass rates steadily declined. However, the November 2021 and 2022 results reverted to the long-term average, indicating that the pandemic's impact on pass rates is subsiding.
          </p>
          <p>
            In November 2022, approximately 12,000 candidates took the exam worldwide, with a 44% pass rate. This figure is expected to remain relatively stable.
          </p>
          <figure class="post-image">

          </figure>

          <h2>Minimum Passing Score</h2>
          <p>
            The Minimum Passing Score is an excellent guide for understanding the score you need to achieve on the exam. It provides a clear benchmark for mock test performance, the optimal time of year to take the exam, and insights into candidates' success.
          </p>
          <p>Keep these general guidelines in mind:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Opt for the November exam slot. Candidates in the Northern Hemisphere often study during summer holidays, making competition more intense. Taking the exam in November provides an advantage IMO.</li>
            <li>Aim for 70% or higher in your mock exams. While I only achieved this in one of the six mock exams I took, it is important to set high expectations. If you score between 60-70%, do not be disheartened, as this range still indicates a strong possibility of passing. However, avoid becoming overconfident.</li>
          </ul>
          <figure class="post-image">
            <img src="/images/writing/cfa-level-2-exam-passing-in-under-300-hours-of-study/minimum-passing-score.png" alt="CFA Level 2 minimum passing score chart" width="1024" height="512" />
            <figcaption>Source: 300 Hours</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Essentially, regardless of your preparation efforts, remember that you are competing against other candidates. Approximately 40% of those taking the exam will pass, and you must aim to surpass a benchmark that typically ranges between 60-70%.
          </p>

          <h2>My Recommended Study Playbook</h2>
          <p>
            Embrace the Pareto Principle in your study plan, keeping in mind that 20% of your time can yield 80% of your results. To optimize your study time, consider these tips:
          </p>
          <p>
            Develop a study work table instead of a timetable. Utilize techniques like Ali Abdaal's spaced repetition, active recall, and spreadsheet system to save time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implement the 25/5 Pomodoro technique for focused study sessions, thoroughly reading chapters and understanding examples before practicing questions on the CFAI practice portal. The portal is so effective that there is no need to waste time buying summaries from prep providers, who may skip important topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that everyone's study timeline is different. For reference, I studied full-time for 2 months before the exam, but 4 months of part-time study could be sufficient. Explore the CFA forum on Reddit to find other candidates' study timelines and choose one that suits your needs. Some people study for 8 months, while others manage in just 4 weeks — it is a personal journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintaining a balanced lifestyle is crucial. Continue seeing close friends, exercising, sleeping well, and taking care of yourself. However, it is important to limit distractions by avoiding large social gatherings, excessive partying, or indulging in alcohol and other substances.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this strategy in place, let's examine the resources I employed to maximize efficiency:
          </p>

          <h2>The only resources you need (that do not break the bank):</h2>
          <p>
            Utilize the CFAI textbooks to gain a deep understanding of the subjects. This is crucial as many exam questions require you to dive deep into specific aspects of the curriculum rather than test your broad knowledge of topics. Be prepared to answer specific questions related to sub-topics, ensuring you have covered the entire curriculum in detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turn to free study summaries (like this one I found on Reddit) and formula sheets, especially towards the end of your studies. The creators of these resources are incredibly helpful. While you could spend money on summaries, I recommend using free ones found online and investing in 6 past papers (2 Schweser and 4 Mark Meldrum) instead. This approach will help you practice effectively without getting overwhelmed by numerous resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aim to complete thousands of questions in the CFAI QBank before your exam. If you encounter any issues, explore dedicated websites like AnalystForum, which can assist you in answering specific queries. This forum addresses 95% of common confusions and questions, and its active community can help with the remaining 5%. They even offer strategies to tackle challenging topics, such as pension expenses.
          </p>

          <h2>Last but not least: Essential items for Exam Day:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Passport</li>
            <li>Calculator (either BA II Texas instruments or Hewlett Packard 12C)</li>
            <li>Snack or lunch for the halfway break</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            By following a personalized adaptation of my strategy for the CFA Level 2 exam, I believe you will be as prepared as possible. Focus on controlling the controllables throughout your journey and managing your nerves on exam day. Approach the exam with a calm and confident attitude, believing that failure is not an option. This mindset will increase your likelihood of success.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not pass, remember that you did everything in your power to prepare, and there is no reason to be upset. Instead, retake the test with renewed determination to conquer the exam.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good luck with your studies, and never lose sight of "why" you are pursuing the CFA charter.
