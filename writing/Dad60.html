            <h2>Dear Dad,</h2>

            <p>Happy 60th Birthday! Today is the day you would have celebrated another decade of life&mdash;the mighty sixty. The age when a &quot;normal&quot; person eagerly awaits retirement, grandchildren, and the chance to grumble about their chronic medication.</p>

            <p>Sadly, these experiences are no longer viable for you, as you now exist only within the confines of my head and in the hearts of those who continue to love you. It&rsquo;s been five years since cancer caused you to depart from us. I wonder if you would like to hear a bit about what&rsquo;s transpired since then?</p>

            <p>The world has changed significantly. South Africa has a new president, the Springboks won the World Cup, we survived a global pandemic, I graduated from school and university, and I am currently halfway across the world as I write this. Life on planet Earth is a bit chaotic, but we&rsquo;re hanging in there. Our family is healthy, Granny is still amusingly annoying, and Roddy and Goggins (our pets) continue to roam Carpe Diem (the name of our home) with a spring in their step.</p>

            <p>Although you&rsquo;ve missed out on a great deal, I still sense your presence beside me. I use the teachings you imparted to me daily and will continue to do so for the rest of my life. I hope it&rsquo;s alright if I take some of these lessons and share them with others. I&rsquo;m sending an abundance of love to the land high up above.</p>

            <h2>With love, Seb &lt;3</h2>

            <h3><em>The Enthusiasm for Enthusiasm</em></h3>

            <p>My dad was a natural workaholic. He devoted most of his adult life to the corporate world, striving to create a comfortable life for his family. Late nights catching up on work were common, followed by early mornings to meet his high standards of excellence. Before becoming a corporate &quot;suit,&quot; he started his career on the factory floor. He worked closely with the factory workers, ensuring efficient processes through the people he managed. He consistently achieved optimisation improvements for every project he undertook. The overall job satisfaction of the factory workers also soared when my dad was on the floor. His success was not due to any complex science, monetary incentives, or clever engineering, but rather a simple character trait he radiated.</p>

            <p>This trait was <strong>enthusiasm</strong>. He imbued his work with enthusiasm, entering flow states that made problem-solving feel like play. He was the catalyst that prompted his workers to be proactive and feel valued. As the years passed, he climbed the corporate ladder, blending his IQ with his continuous enthusiasm. While he enjoyed the financial security his increased compensation brought, I could tell he didn&rsquo;t have the same sparkle in his eye when he used to recount stories of his factory days. I dearly miss the times when he would return from work, smelling like a deep-sea fisherman, eager to update us on the latest fish finger prototype he was crafting.</p>

            <p>Practicing enthusiasm pays off, both spiritually and mentally. My father&rsquo;s focus on this trait opened doors for him that he otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have had. I noticed that the days I listened more, joked more, and deeply engaged with my peers more, I garnered more respect.</p>

            <p><em>I am using enthusiasm as a synonym to empathy, because empathy is a broad term for understanding emotion. In contrast, enthusiasm lifts the energy and vibe within a room.</em></p>

            <h3>Share Your Highs, Share Your Lows</h3>

            <p>In my family, I am the eldest of two younger brothers. Because of this, my dad placed a significant responsibility on me to set a good example for them. As much as I wanted to do that, I also had a competitive streak and enjoyed asserting my dominance over my brothers. Whether during a run or a game of FIFA, I always aimed to win. This competitive nature often resulted in physical fights, much to my dad&rsquo;s displeasure. His strategy was to physically punish me to show how it felt&mdash;thus, the infamous &quot;klip&quot; or the flick of the ear was born.</p>

            <p>Though corporal punishment wasn&rsquo;t the most progressive approach, it did toughen me up, preparing me to face numerous challenges in the years to follow. Against my dad, however, it only turned me into a somewhat disobedient rebel. I relished the cheeky attention that came from defying my parents. Even though there wasn&rsquo;t much to gain from this behaviour, it laid the groundwork for the profound conversations my dad would later have with me once he realized that physical punishment wasn&rsquo;t the answer to adolescent mischief.</p>

            <p>After my parents&rsquo; divorce, my dad began sharing more than I was ready for at the time. He openly discussed his current hardships, candidly expressing the emotions they elicited, often with a cigarette in hand. Especially during the last six months of his life, he shared his philosophies and regrets. We talked about love and life, and he frequently quoted passages from the book &quot;The Alchemist.&quot; My father, like me, was the eldest of his siblings, and this commonality fostered a deep connection between us. It was especially unique for me have these heavy conversations with my dad - when just six months prior to his fatal diagnosis I was sneaking alcohol from his liquor cabinet and getting absolutely blasted every weekend with my friends without his knowing. However, with time, I came to understand the importance of the emotions he passed down to me. We laughed, fought, cried, and most importantly, loved each other.</p>

            <p>The lesson I gleaned from my relationship with my father is that there&rsquo;s never a wrong time to share your highs and lows. Without his openness about his struggles, I wouldn&rsquo;t have understood why he made the decisions he did, and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t have learned from his mistakes. The same applied to his victories, and now I stand on his shoulders as I embark on my journey into the world as a young adult.</p>

            <h3>The Leap of Faith</h3>

            <p>When was the last time you made a decision that forever changed the trajectory of your life, one that filled you with anxiety about what might happen if you chose that path?</p>

            <p>My dad quit his job when I was around 11 years old. At first, he told me it was because he needed a break from working and wanted to start a business he&rsquo;d always dreamt of. I later found out he was ousted for speaking his mind during a board meeting, providing me with yet another vicarious lesson thanks to him. Regardless, let&rsquo;s not digress. He spent the next year recovering from a long stint in the corporate world that had paid him well and ensured our family&rsquo;s security. We lived comfortably in a large house in a good neighbourhood with beautiful views. Money was never a concern, even with eight people living in our home&mdash;that is, until my dad started his startup.</p>

            <p>His two years of unemployment allowed him to spend more time with us and strategise ways to work for himself. He founded Footprint Management Solutions, a consulting firm that advised food companies on how to optimise their processes. This venture led him to take over a dog food business called K9 Petfoods, a mid-tier player in the South African dog food market. My dad had big dreams for the company and worked tirelessly to make it a success, convinced he had found a niche through a healthier wet food alternative.</p>

            <p>Against all odds, he initially made the business profitable. But this success was short-lived, and he soon faced cash flow and profitability problems that bit him hard. His Achilles&rsquo; heel was underestimating the funding needed to sustain the company, forcing him to deplete our family&rsquo;s savings. We had to rent out our home, move into a smaller condo, and sell the holiday house we had owned for 14 years. As privileged as we were, these changes were tough to swallow as an insecure adolescent. My father became so engrossed in making his businesses work that he overlooked his family&rsquo;s emotional needs, making things difficult at home. Long story short, he had to surrender all his shares in the company to avoid bankruptcy. Even more devastating, he had to give up his dreams of owning a successful company.</p>

            <p>This experience marked a defining moment in his life: he had to confront failure. In the process, he lost his wife, his money, and his self-esteem. However, his story wasn&rsquo;t all heartbreak. In the years that followed, he served his children as best any father could hope to do, laying a foundation for his spirit to live on through us.</p>

            <p>This bitter failure of someone I believed would always pull a rabbit out of the hat reshaped my perspective. The invaluable lesson I learned from this story is particularly relevant at this stage in my life. What if I asked you to run a marathon tomorrow without any training? Do you think you could do it? If not, how can you truly know that your mind isn&rsquo;t deceiving you until you&rsquo;ve attempted the challenge and failed? Only after you try and fail will you understand what it takes to overcome your challenges. My father took that leap of faith and paid the price. Only then did he truly understand the sacrifices required to chase his dreams. Despite the lack of any visible positive outcome, he gained a deep understanding of his capabilities and learned about himself more than most of us do. The lesson I learned from him gave me the most powerful tool in my arsenal&mdash;the leap of faith. These leaps require practice, and I&rsquo;ve started taking a few. The more I take, the more comfortable I become. I know that when I fail, I will have the courage to bounce back stronger.</p>

            <p>If we can learn from my father&rsquo;s playbook:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>cultivating enthusiasm,</li>
              <li>sharing our highs and lows,</li>
              <li>and taking more leaps of faith</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I believe we can embark on a lifelong journey that promises a life worth living. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but who ever said that a roller coaster ride isn&rsquo;t fun was lying. So, hop on, buckle up, and enjoy the ride!</p>
