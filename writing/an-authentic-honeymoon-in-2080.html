            </figure>

            <p>The first thing Michelle did, before her eyes even fully adjusted to the morning light, was check her <em>NetScore</em>.</p>

            <p>She swiped her hand through the air, and a light projected over her palm. <em>The Network</em> feed magically flickered to life. Beautiful people laughed on yachts, adventured through forests, and tanned on beaches. She tried to ignore it and tapped the small icon in the corner.</p>

            <p><strong>MICHELLE: 325</strong></p>

            <p>The number just sat there, impassive. She felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach. No change. She had spent three hours last night editing and posting their wedding photos, tagging the venue, the caterer, the trendy new florist who infused empathogen aromas into the flowers to simulate the feeling of love. The post had yielded seven reactions.</p>

            <p>Beneath her polished <em>Network</em> feed, Michelle and Mike genuinely loved each other. Real love was rare these days. However, in 2080, real love needed an audience to survive.</p>

            <p>She glanced at Mike, still asleep beside her, his soft snoring filling their small apartment. She tapped on his profile.</p>

            <p><strong>MIKE: 320</strong></p>

            <p>Still five points behind her. Michelle sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the city outside. She scrolled back to the feed, her thumb moving automatically. There was her sister Jen. Laughing, jumping off a cliff into water so blue it hurt to look at. A <em>NetScore</em> of 1,081 glowed beneath her name.</p>

            <p>"Lost in the void again darling?" Mike mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.</p>

            <p>Michelle swiped the projection away. "Just checking the feed."</p>

            <p>"Anything good?"</p>

            <p>"Jen met Vektora at one of her famous parties last night. I really wish I could have been there."</p>

            <p>Mike groaned and rolled over, pulling the thin blanket over his head. "Don't let it get to you, Mich. It probably wasn't <em>thaaat</em> amazing."</p>

            <p>"It stings," she said, sitting up. Her voice was sharp. "The <em>HypeTravel</em> appointment is in an hour."</p>

            <p>Mike's head emerged. "You really think this honeymoon... 'content package'... is going to change anything? We're 300s, Mich. We're <em>Invisibles</em>."</p>

            <p>"I refuse to live this way anymore," she said, her voice fierce. "Jen got us the referral. This is our chance. You said it yourself, marriage makes good content. Good content is the only way up." She looked at the blank wall where the feed had been. "I'm not going to end up like one of those... those people who just stop trying. The ones who disappear."</p>

            <p>Mike looked at her wearily. He knew she was right. In a world where AI and robotics had replaced nearly every kind of real work, the only jobs left were for the seen. At the top were the <em>Virals</em>, like Jen, paid by <em>The Network</em> for their ability to attract attention. At the bottom were the <em>Invisibles</em>, spending their lives either consuming <em>Viral</em> content or, like them, desperately trying to become one.</p>

            <p>"Okay," he said, swinging his legs out of bed. "Let's go get seen."</p>

            <p>They now sat in a sterile white office across from a woman with a perfectly dimpled smile and skin so tight she looked their age. "Welcome to <em>HypeTravel</em>, lovebirds. I'm Melissa, your Travel Curator for the honeymoon. Golly me, how exciting this must be for you two." A large <em>Network</em> logo pulsed on the wall behind them.</p>

            <p>Melissa slid a tablet between them. "Before we begin, we need to confirm a few things." She tapped the screen. Their profiles appeared side by side, hovering above their names:</p>

            <p><strong>MIKE: 320</strong></p>

            <p><strong>MICHELLE: 325</strong></p>

            <p>Melissa frowned, the first genuine expression they'd seen. She quickly smoothed her face back into a perfect smile. "I'm just a little confused about how you were able to book this appointment. We only work with 600+ <em>Invisibles</em>. Below that, the chances of going <em>Viral</em> are practically nonexistent."</p>

            <p>Michelle panicked, her fingers trembling slightly. "We were referred by Jen, a successful client of yours who became <em>Viral</em>."</p>

            <p>Melissa blinked, the name sounding familiar. She swiped through her tablet. Jen's profile appeared: A <em>NetScore</em> of 1,081. She swiped again and some photos from Jen's profile appeared. Hiking in the Alps. Partying on yachts in the Caribbean. Beaching on the Mediterranean. Melissa's face returned to a perfect smile. "Ahh yesss, Jen. She was a very successful client of ours. Perhaps our best." She then noticed something else. "Mmm. That's strange. Her account shouldn't be able to issue referrals anymore."</p>

            <p>"Jen is my sister," said Michelle. "She sent us the link herself last week. We only ever talk through <em>Network</em> messenger now, but she's always online."</p>

            <p>Melissa tapped once more. "Strange," she repeated to herself. "The system must have recycled her data." A pause. "It seems this is all a big mixup. I'll have to go ahead and cancel it."</p>

            <p>"No, please don't do that," said Michelle. She sat forward in her chair. "Jen said this could change everything for us. You have to understand, we are not like other <em>Invisibles</em>. We are unique."</p>

            <p>"Everybody believes their story is different," said Melissa. "It never is."</p>

            <p>"You don't get it," said Michelle. "In this world, if nobody sees you, you don't exist."</p>

            <p>"We're already ghosts," Mike added. "Maybe this is our last chance to be real."</p>

            <p>"And you think this will make it better?" asked Melissa.</p>

            <p>Mike hesitated. "Everyone wants to be <em>Viral</em>. It's the only kind of freedom left."</p>

            <p>Melissa studied them for a long moment. Her perfect smile faded, replaced for a single beat by a look of cold, satisfied appraisal.</p>

            <p>"Hmmm, you really are desperate then," said Melissa.</p>

            <p>"YESSS!!!," the couple said together.</p>

            <p>Melissa leaned back in her chair. "I remember being where you are. Wanting more, thinking the system was unfair." Her smile returned, but it was different now. Slightly sharper. More calculated. "The '600+' clients... they're just window dressing. The real opportunity, the one Jen took, is for those willing to do whatever it takes. People like you." She smiled faintly. "The truth is, the system rewards those who give it what it wants. That's what going <em>Viral</em> is all about. You have to surrender to the <em>Network</em>, and let it decide who you truly are."</p>

            <p>"Then help us," said Michelle. Her hands were visibly shaking at this point.</p>

            <p>Melissa tilted her head. "Do you know what Jen is doing now?"</p>

            <p>"She is traveling the world. Having fun with other <em>Virals</em>," said Michelle.</p>

            <figure class="post-image">
              <img src="/images/writing/an-authentic-honeymoon-in-2080/scene-2.jpg" alt="A bright, curated travel scene framed like a feed post" width="1200" height="900" />
            </figure>

            <p>"Precisely." Melissa's tone softened, almost admiring. "It's beautiful, isn't it? The way people reinvent themselves. But the <em>Network</em> never gives without taking. You don't move from a 287 to a 1,081 <em>NetScore</em> without leaving something of yourself behind."</p>

            <p>"Leaving what behind, exactly?" asked Mike.</p>

            <p>She tapped the screen. The wall behind her pulsed...</p>

            <p><strong>ASCENSION PACKAGE: PHASE III TRIALS</strong></p>

            <p>Blue light shimmered across their faces. "What is it?" asked Michelle.</p>

            <p>Melissa smiled faintly. "A continuation of Jen's journey. We call it the Ascension Package. Phase Three is for candidates the system sees potential in, people like you."</p>

            <p>Mike frowned. "What does that mean?"</p>

            <p>"It means you have the same opportunity Jen had," said Melissa. "Ascension is a curated experience designed to accelerate your <em>NetScore</em> growth and unlock your most authentic selves."</p>

            <p>Michelle's eyes brightened. "So we get to go on our honeymoon?"</p>

            <p>Melissa laughed softly. "Sort of. Not you, exactly. Rather, digital versions of yourselves. We build versions of you that live inside the <em>Network</em>. They do the traveling, the parties, the smiling for the cameras. But the difference is, they actually are authentic. They are powered by the raw, unfiltered you." Her smile sharpened. "They don't put on a charade like real people do. And the world will love them for it."</p>

            <p>Michelle leaned forward. "And it really worked for Jen?"</p>

            <p>"She's our highest performer," Melissa said. "People all around the world adore her now."</p>

            <p>"We adore her too," Michelle whispered.</p>

            <p>"Wait," said Mike. "What happens to us while all this is happening?"</p>

            <p>"Good question, Mike," said Melissa. Her tone stayed cheerful. "You will rest in specialised sleeping pods. Our professional medical team will oversee the entire process. After your honeymoon period, you will wake up renewed. By then, we hope your Avatars will have made great progress towards becoming <em>Viral</em>."</p>

            <p>"So they get the honeymoon, and we get a nap?" Mike muttered.</p>

            <p>Melissa simply ignored him. Mike couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He looked at Melissa's perfect smile again, and then back at Michelle. "Something's wrong, my love. Let's just take a normal trip, just the two of us. I don't want to do any of this pod nonsense. Let's get out of here." He stood up, reaching for her hand.</p>

            <p>But Michelle didn't take it. She looked at him calmly, almost detached. "Go where, Mike?" she asked. "Back to your eighty-hour workweeks? To a life where we're treated like dirt by people with better <em>NetScores</em>? We've tried. This is our only chance at real freedom."</p>

            <p>Mike stared at her for a long, hollow second. He wanted to argue, but he couldn't. She was right.</p>

            <p>Melissa sliced through the silence. "Trust me, you two, this is the biggest opportunity of your lives. Think about the headlines... Couple goes from sub-300 <em>Invisible</em> to <em>Viral</em> in under three weeks. Everything will change for the better."</p>

            <p>Melissa slowly slid the tablet between them again, displaying the contract for them to sign.</p>

            <p>Mike looked at Michelle again. "Honey, I don't feel good about this," he whispered.</p>

            <p>"I know honey, me too," she said softly. "But I know Jen, and she always makes the best choices." She kissed him on the cheek. "Let's do this. Together."</p>

            <p>Mike smiled weakly and kissed her back. Michelle took the stylus and signed. Mike signed too.</p>

            <p>"Excellent," said Melissa. She tapped her earpiece. "Intake team, we're ready for extraction."</p>

            <p>"Wait," said Mike. "Right now?"</p>

            <p>"Of course," said Melissa. "The pods are ready. We've found that immediate extraction helps with a smoother transition."</p>

            <p>The office door clicked open. Two attendants in grey uniforms stepped in, each wearing the silver <em>Network</em> insignia on their chest. Their smiles were identical to Melissa's, fixed and synthetic. "Congratulations on your Ascension," one of them said.</p>

            <p>"No," Mike blurted, knocking his chair backward. "I change my mind. We change our minds."</p>

            <p>The attendants' smiles didn't move. One took his arm, firm and polite. "The contract is <em>Network</em>-binding, sir," the attendant said. "It's already been processed."</p>

            <p>Mike tried to pull away, but the attendant's hand clamped around his arm like a bear trap.</p>

            <p>Michelle stood and took his other hand, her own trembling. "It's okay, Mike," she whispered, though her voice quivered. "We're in this together."</p>

            <p>They were led out of the office and down a long, narrow corridor. The air hummed with a low-frequency current, and the walls smelled of antiseptic. The only light came from translucent panels scrolling the same messages in a slow loop:</p>

            <p><strong>YOU ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO REAL AUTHENTICITY.</strong></p>

            <p>They entered a cave of glass and steel. Hundreds of pods lined the room symmetrically, stretching back so deep the lights from the active screens looked like distant, cold stars. The attendants guided them to two near the entrance, side by side. Straps tightened around their arms and chests, or "comfort bands," as one of them called them. An IV line slid into each of their arms. Above each pod hung a large screen.</p>

            <p>"You might begin to feel a little fuzzy," the attendant said cheerfully. "Like remembering a wonderful party where you drank one too many glasses of wine."</p>

            <p>A needle slid into Mike's arm. He saw a flash of perfect, blue water. Michelle was laughing, her skin tanning in the warm sun.</p>

            <p>Then Michelle's turn. She saw her wedding day. Her father's arms in hers as they walked down the aisle. He whispered to her not to care about what her friends thought of her. She saw Jen smiling at her in the crowd. Her vision jumped to her kissing Mike. They embraced in a real moment of love. For one fleeting second, she felt whole. The only moment she had ever felt truly free from the possession of the <em>Network</em>.</p>

            <p>Then, nothing.</p>

            <p>They both woke up. Their mouths tasted like old pennies and stale air.</p>

            <p>The screen above him flickered on. It displayed a heaving party, in a magical forest surrounded by a large cascading waterfall. Mike was twirling Michelle to the beat of the music. It looked perfect.</p>

            <p><strong>MIKE: 1,241<br />MICHELLE: 1,250</strong></p>

            <p>Melissa's cheerful voice emerged from a speaker in the pod. "Meet your Ascension Avatars! Congratulations, you two. You're officially <em>Viral</em>!"</p>

            <p>Mike watched the man on the screen, the other Mike. He saw how he made Michelle laugh, how he charmed all these other people at the party. The screen showed him a perfect version of himself, a version he always thought Michelle deserved.</p>

            <p>Michelle watched her avatar doing the Salsa, moving her hips in a flow of catharsis to the rhythms of the dancefloor. She was entranced by her beauty.</p>

            <p>"That's not us," Mike said, his voice a dry croak.</p>

            <p>"Of course it is," said Melissa's voice. "It's the authentic you. It's powered by you. The 'comfort bands' are reading your limbic system right now."</p>

            <p>"I don't care. You can untie us now, Melissa. You said three weeks." Mike tried to move, but the comfort bands didn't budge. His limbs felt foreign.</p>

            <p>"It took three weeks for your avatars to go <em>Viral</em>," said Melissa. "They live only inside the <em>Network</em>."</p>

            <p>"For how much longer?" Michelle whispered.</p>

            <p>"Oh, um, indefinitely," Melissa said with a straight face. "They can only stay <em>Viral</em> as long as you keep feeding their algorithms your neuroempathy data. You are directly connected to them."</p>

            <p>"You lied," Michelle said.</p>

            <p>"I sold you a dream," Melissa's voice replied. "And it worked! The three-week trial data was so positive, the <em>Network</em> automatically extended your contract to permanent status. You're just that authentic. Congratulations!"</p>

            <p>A slot in the pod wall hissed open. A tray slid out. On it was a bowl of gray, shimmering paste. A label on the bowl said, "NUTRI-SLOP: MONDAY." Mike gagged. The smell was rancid, like burnt plastic.</p>

            <p>"My avatar gets a waterfall, and I get... despair pudding," Mike croaked. "Seems fair."</p>

            <p>"Perfect!" said Melissa's voice from the speaker. "A genuine disgust reaction! We're feeding that neuroempathy data to your avatar right now. He'll use it for a very hilarious food review he will post to the <em>Network</em> this evening."</p>

            <p>"How many?" Mike asked, his voice numb. "How many people have you done this to?"</p>

            <p>The speaker clicked off and the couple sat in silence.</p>

            <p>They watched their virtual avatars on their screens, laughing in delight as they did cannonballs into the waterfall's plunge pool. A single tear rolled down Mike's face.</p>

            <p>Then Mike heard Michelle make a small, choked sound. She was staring to her right.</p>

            <p>Through the glass partition, Mike saw another pod. A woman sat inside, zombified. Her eyes were wide and empty, fixed on the screen above her.</p>

            <p>A label on her pod read: JENNIFER K</p>

            <p>"Jen?" Michelle pressed her hand to the glass. "JEN!"</p>

            <p>Jen didn't move. She just stared at the screen. But on the screen above her pod, the virtual Jen, lounging on a yacht in the Caribbean, turned to the camera, blew a kiss, and winked. A pre-recorded voice-over chimed, "Shout out to my amazing sister, who always believed in me!"</p>

            <p>Mike pressed his hand against the glass, reaching toward his wife. Michelle pressed hers back. Their fingers hovered an inch apart, divided by the glass wall.</p>

            <p>At that exact moment, on the screens above, their perfect avatars held hands and kissed for the camera. Their <em>NetScores</em> climbed.</p>

            <p>"They're better at being us than we ever were," Michelle whispered, her voice cracking.</p>

            <p>Mike said nothing. The two pods sat side-by-side. Two hands pressed against the glass, failing to touch. On their screens, they saw that over a million people were reacting to the livestream of them kissing.</p>

            <p>Through the pod speaker came the faint sound of an office door opening. Melissa must have forgotten to switch it off. Or perhaps she hadn't. "Welcome to <em>HypeTravel</em>, lovebirds. I'm Melissa, your Travel Curator for your honeymoon. Golly me, how exciting this must be for you two!"</p>

            <p>A notification then chimed through the pod speakers. A popup filled their screens:</p>

            <p><strong>CONGRATULATIONS. YOU ARE NOW IN THE TOP 5% OF ALL <em>VIRALS</em>. KEEP BEING AUTHENTIC.</strong></p>

            <p>And the couple lay in their pods, with no other option but to keep watching the avatars that replaced them.</p>
