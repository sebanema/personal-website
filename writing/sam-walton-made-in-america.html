            <h2>TL;DR</h2>

            <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the reading experience. It's an easy, well-written account by Sam himself, detailing the rise of his Walmart empire.</p>

            <p>Overall, I think he could have gone into more detail about his grinding in the early days of Walmart - I usually find these times in the lifetime of a business to be the most interesting. Instead, the book moves into the post-scaling stages quite quickly. That said, it's still packed with actionable business lessons and insights into the innovations Walmart pioneered as a company.</p>

            <p><strong>FINAL RATING: 7.5/10</strong></p>

            <p>Below I go over Sam Walton's startup advice and the innovations Walmart made during its rise, which I think is very useful knowledge:</p>

            <h2>Startup Advice</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Always serve the customer first.</strong> Exceed your customers expectations and strive to "guarantee satisfaction". If you're able to lower costs of your sales, pass that win through to your customer.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples of Walmart lowering costs:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cut out middlemen by sourcing merchandise directly from manufacturers.</li>
                  <li>Employees were usually underpaid and overworked compared to industry competitors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tradeoffs I noticed:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Employee wages suffered and employee burnout increased at the expense of the customer, although they usually were compensated in profit-sharing schemes or stock.</li>
                  <li>Lowest-cost manufacturing shifted supply chains to China. Many American factories either closed or relocated.</li>
                  <li>Small niche stores died out as Walmart scaled and outperformed them across merchandise categories. Customers won on price and convenience, but communities lost diversity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Comment:</strong> I think Jeff Bezos took inspiration from Sam on this principle. Without customers, you have no business.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Solve issues at the micro level.</strong> You learn your customers problems most intimately when you are closest to them. This means that you need to visit the stores (conduct field-work) to gain valuable insights.</p>
                <p><strong>Comment:</strong> Although its much easier to be decentralized today with remote working and communication technology, experiencing the sales process and talking to customers directly would enable greater insights.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Frugality as principle.</strong> Overheads should stay under 2% of sales (Sam thumbsucked this lol). Keep the business lean and fight bureaucracy.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sam traveled economy with associates and insisted on barebones offices.</p>
                <p><strong>Comment:</strong> I have experienced working for a startup with this mindset. It probably scares away those looking for cushy perks and benefits, although I believe it would probably bring together scrappy action-orientated people looking to make an impact (for the benefit of the customer and the higher vision, rather than for themselves).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Incentivize employees properly.</strong> Three ways Sam advocates to incentivize employees:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Award profit-sharing, stock ownership and cash award opportunities to employees early on in their tenure with your company. Incentivize long-term employees through vesting stock over staggered periods of time.</li>
                  <li>Celebrate your employees success. They should be recognized for doing a good job.</li>
                  <li>Give employees responsibility early and encourage them to act like owners.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Comment:</strong> This is a hugely important point, but also a difficult one to get right. People are motivated by different things, so developing a deep understanding and methods to incentivize accordingly is essential for any successful operation. And it doesn't just apply to employees. It applies equally to customers, and even to you as a leader.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Communication is king.</strong> Sam advocates for constant, transparent communication across teams. As Walmart scaled, data and technology became the backbone of this communication, enabling faster and better decisions.</p>
                <p><strong>Comment:</strong> Today's technology makes this far easier than in the 70s, but it is still a point that must not be overlooked. Sam ties the idea back to being an effective communicator yourself, which comes from sharing ideas clearly, seeking help, and enabling teams to work better together. Technology also increases the speed at which information becomes available, so data can be analysed quickly and decisions made on time.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Culture makes the difference.</strong> The workplace was designed to be fun, with contests, singers and speakers at Saturday meetings, and even a company-wide song to unite employees on special occasions.</p>
                <p>Sam set customer rules like the "10-foot rule," where associates greeted anyone within ten feet, and he introduced greeters at the store doors.</p>
                <p>He insisted on transparency through an open-door policy where associates could talk to him directly, and by sharing company performance numbers widely.</p>
                <p>He built obsession into the culture with Saturday meetings, showing that work-life balance was minimal but that he believed obsession was the price of winning.</p>
                <p><strong>Comment:</strong> Most business people these days say culture is the most important aspect of a business. As trite as it is, it is true and works towards uniting a people behind a common cause.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Innovations</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Discount store revolution.</strong> Walmart introduced everyday low pricing instead of promotional cycles. This approach meant lower margins, higher volume, and stronger customer loyalty.</li>
              <li><strong>Rural market focus.</strong> Walmart moved into towns under 50,000 that competitors ignored. These towns proved they could support large-format stores, and they thrived because demand was real and underserved.</li>
              <li><strong>Concentric expansion.</strong> The company grew outward from Arkansas like ink spots, saturating each region before moving on. This strategy created economies of scale around distribution centers, generated word-of-mouth dominance, and built barriers for competitors once Walmart had locked in a region.</li>
              <li><strong>Distribution and supply chain.</strong> Distribution centers operated on a hub-and-spoke model, buying in bulk and replenishing nearby stores at low cost. This model replaced the older point-to-point system, where suppliers delivered directly to stores but missed the savings of bulk distribution. Cross-docking further reduced costs by moving goods directly from supplier trucks onto outbound store trucks with almost no warehousing. Walmart also built its own in-house trucking fleet, which gave it greater control, higher reliability, and lower costs.</li>
              <li><strong>Technology adoption.</strong> Walmart was among the first to roll out computerized point-of-sale systems and barcode scanning, which enabled real-time sales data and automatic reorders. In 1987, it launched a private satellite communication system with two-way data and voice and one-way video, essentially an early version of Zoom for retail. This allowed company-wide meetings and faster decision-making. In 1991, Walmart introduced Retail Link, giving suppliers live access to its sales data. Unlike Kmart, which kept data guarded, Walmart's transparency allowed partners like Procter &amp; Gamble to ramp up supply efficiently, and their Walmart sales jumped sharply within months.</li>
              <li><strong>Format expansion.</strong> In 1983 Walmart launched Sam's Club, a warehouse club that competed with Price Club and Costco, scaling quickly thanks to Walmart's logistics strength. In 1988 it opened its first Supercenter, combining food and general merchandise. Borrowed from Europe's hypermarkets, Walmart executed better and made the model stick.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest takeaways I had from reading the book is that Sam Walton was always iterating and experimenting within Walmart. Many of his ideas were doubted or dismissed by those around him. Most of his innovations or imitations began as pilots in just a few stores, and plenty of them never caught on. He was quick to acknowledge failure and move on without hesitation.</p>
            <p>That mindset continues to inspire me. The willingness to try, fail, and try again is rare, but it's what drives breakthroughs. In many ways, America has built a culture around this kind of experimentation, where failure is part of the process and innovation is the reward.</p>
            <p>Sam also believed in going against the grain. If everyone else was doing something one way, he swam upstream and often found success where no one else was looking. That contrarian instinct, paired with relentless execution, is a big part of why Walmart became what it is.</p>
            <p>I'm grateful to be able to read about entrepreneurs who embodied this attitude in both business and life.</p>
