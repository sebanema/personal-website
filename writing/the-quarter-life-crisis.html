            <p>"Once I earn enough money, I'll quit my job and do everything on my bucket list."</p>

            <p>This is the deferred life-plan in a nutshell: the seductive idea that real life begins only after you achieve X.</p>

            <p>I grew up with this mentality. I believed that only after reaching a certain level of financial independence would I have earned the right to ask myself, "What would I do with my life if money were no object?"</p>

            <p>Many people never reach this point. They are shackled to a goalpost that constantly moves further away as their lifestyle inflates.</p>

            <h2>Ignorance is bliss</h2>

            <p>When I was younger, dreaming of what I wanted to be was easy. One day, a professional rugby player; the next, a rocket scientist. But as the years rolled on and the world unfurled before me, I realized there were countless life paths available, and to my great frustration, I wanted to walk all of them.</p>

            <p>I have always been insatiably curious. I was the classic child who pestered his parents with questions like, "Why is the sky blue?" My curiosity wasn't just cosmic; it was deeply human. I wanted to understand the texture of other lives. What does it feel like to be a Fortune 500 CEO, an Antarctic adventurer, or a rockstar? What is the inner world of an evangelical preacher, a person experiencing homelessness, or even a Somali pirate?</p>

            <p>This curiosity fueled two things: a voracious reading habit and a drive to try everything. Like someone throwing spaghetti against a wall to see what sticks, I dabbled in countless extracurriculars. Each new skill tree was a world to explore:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Playing the trombone.</li>
              <li>Singing in choirs.</li>
              <li>Writing essays and short stories.</li>
              <li>Playing sports like rugby, cricket, water polo, swimming and running.</li>
              <li>Outdoor adventure activities like scuba diving, life saving, adventure hiking, camping and backpacking across several countries.</li>
            </ul>

            <figure class="post-image">
              <img src="/images/writing/the-quarter-life-crisis/scene-2.jpg" alt="A collage of hobbies and pursuits" width="1200" height="800" />
            </figure>

            <p>Because I had a decent aptitude for most of these pursuits and a novelty-seeking brain, no single activity ever commanded my complete obsession.</p>

            <p>Therefore, I became a generalist.</p>

            <p>The problem with being a generalist is the feeling that you haven't found your thing. My brother found running; my close friend is obsessed with Artificial Intelligence. Their passions are a gravitational center around which every life decision orbits.</p>

            <p>I have not committed to a specialty yet. I have faith in my destiny, yet I cannot escape the anxious feeling of uncertainty that periodically rises in my chest.</p>

            <p>As trite as it may sound, my character arc is best summed up by the full version of the classic phrase:</p>

            <p>"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."</p>

            <h2>The Path of Least Resistance</h2>

            <p>My traditional all-boys school was a world of clear rules and dependable rewards. It offered a structured path to mastery in everything. In sports, the goal was the A-team. In academics, it was top marks. Follow the path, apply discipline, and a sense of accomplishment was practically guaranteed.</p>

            <p>This system was fantastic for building my confidence and self-esteem. The hidden curriculum, however, was a deep-seated bias for the path of least resistance. It trained me to instinctively choose activities where the route to success was already mapped out.</p>

            <p>I now have the language for this, courtesy of author David Epstein: my entire youth was spent in "kind" learning environments, where rules are stable and feedback is immediate. The real world, I would soon discover, is a "wicked" learning environment, where the rules constantly change and feedback is often delayed, confusing, or nonexistent.</p>

            <p>This isn't to scorn "kind" environments. My love for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, with its clear progression to a black belt, is a testament to their power in building skills. The problem wasn't the environment itself; it was my assumption that the entire world worked that way.</p>

            <p>This led to an unavoidable conclusion: I was over-indexed on security and under-indexed on risk.</p>

            <h2>Popping the Bubble</h2>

            <p>School and university life exists inside a bubble. Everyone is on a similar path, sharing classes, sports, and social lives. This forges a sacred sense of community and protects everyone from the vagaries of the outside world. It's a marvelous illusion.</p>

            <p>My bubble popped during a second-year internship at Invictus Capital. I arrived on day one, eager to see how a company actually worked and ready to apply my hard-earned knowledge. My first task was to build a spreadsheet of new trading opportunities for a cross-currency arbitrage. Full of textbook confidence, I asked my boss, "Which exchanges should I use? How do I identify good pairs? How many should I find?"</p>

            <p>He looked at me directly and said, "Seb, if I knew the answers, I wouldn't be asking you. Go figure it out."</p>

            <p>That was the defining moment. In that instant, two things became brutally clear. First, no one was ever going to hold my hand again. Second, the game I had spent my life mastering - the one with syllabuses and memorandums - was officially over.</p>

            <p>After the initial shock, my curiosity took over and helped me adapt. And in the process, I learned something important. The validation of getting a good grade is one thing. But the satisfaction of chasing down an answer that doesn't exist in a book, of truly finding something out for myself? That was a far more powerful feeling.</p>

            <p>Returning to university for my final year felt hollow. The structured world I once loved now seemed like a pale abstraction of reality. I had craved structure, but now I craved the chaos. I knew I had to go back to the real world to learn how to solve unknown problems and, ultimately, to face my fear of the dark.</p>

            <h2>Startups</h2>

            <p>After university, I made my first real bet on uncertainty. Instead of pursuing a postgraduate degree, I went back to Invictus. I knew I was done with the structured world of formal education; I wanted to take learning into my own hands.</p>

            <p>But I wasn't a true convert yet. I hedged my bet, committing to study for the CFA exams on the side. I never intended to go corporate, but the qualification was my safety net - a parachute I could pull if my experiments with risk went into a nosedive.</p>

            <p>Then, Invictus went bust.</p>

            <p>The collapse thrust me into a short break travelling through South East Asia. With no debt, no commitments, and no itinerary, I felt truly free for the first time. The trip reawakened the part of me that thrives on risk and boundless possibility. I felt limitless, like that kid dreaming of becoming a professional sportsman.</p>

            <p>Rejuvenated, I came home and - as promised to myself - kept working on the CFAs. I experimented with another startup, an e-commerce platform. I hated it and quit after three months. It felt like a detour, but I knew I had to keep trying.</p>

            <p>Then I found Yellow. I worked there for two years, and it became the crucible for everything I was trying to learn. Yellow operates on the frontiers of Africa, supplying solar power and cellphone financing to off-grid communities. Navigating business there was exactly what you'd imagine: a constant tangle of red tape and corruption that demanded creative solutions at every turn.</p>

            <p>Yellow humbled me many times and taught me invaluable lessons on the nature of uncertainty. Here are the most important ones:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Every system is fallible. Question everything.</li>
              <li>Own your outcomes. The buck starts and stops with you.</li>
              <li>Humility is non-negotiable. No task is beneath you.</li>
              <li>Make it easy for others to help you. If you need something from someone outside your domain, do 90% of the work to get their input. True agency means clearing the path for others.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Working at Yellow was the ultimate teacher. It took two years, but the experience finally broke the shackles of my old institutional instincts. It wasn't easy, but it led me here, to the cusp of a new adventure. I was no longer just tolerating uncertainty; I was finally learning to welcome it.</p>

            <h2>The Yellow Brick Road</h2>

            <p>The goal isn't to eliminate uncertainty, but to befriend it.</p>

            <p>I'm now entering a new phase, deliberately swapping a purely analytical approach for a creative one. After seven years spent cultivating discipline, I finally feel equipped to break the cycle and explore new projects and places.</p>

            <p>I admit, the analyst in me isn't going anywhere. I've already built a spreadsheet to track these creative experiments - video essays, articles, painting, music production, maybe even dance classes.</p>

            <p>For the next six months, I have no fixed expectations. My only goal is a genuine commitment to curiosity. I don't regret not starting sooner because I wasn't ready then. Now, my intention is simply to fire up the serendipity machine and see what magic unfolds.</p>

            <p>We all move through life at our own pace. Ultimately, the goal is to live a life our future self will be proud of.</p>

            <p>That's a journey worth taking.</p>
